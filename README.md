# GuildBoard

At-a-glance guild roster dashboard with grouping, item level parsing, alt detection, and powerful filters.

## Features

- **5 Group Modes** — group by Class, Role (note-based), Rank, Level Range, or Online Status via dropdown menu
- **Note-Based Roles** — Role grouping reads Tank/Healer/DPS from guild notes; `ALL` keyword places a member in every role group; unmatched members go to Unknown
- **Item Level Column** — extracts iLvl from guild notes using configurable patterns
- **Alt Detection** — identifies alts by note patterns (e.g. notes starting with "ALT")
- **Powerful Filters** — Show Offline, Hide Alts, Min Level, Min iLvl — all in the toolbar
- **Search** — instantly filter by name, class, zone, rank, or note content
- **Collapsible Groups** — click headers to collapse/expand, each showing online count
- **Raid Ready Counter** — status bar tracks max-level characters (respects alt filter)
- **Class Colors** — color bar, icon, and class-tinted name on every row
- **Member Tooltips** — hover for full details: level, class, rank, zone, notes, alt info, raid readiness
- **Context Menu** — right-click to whisper or invite online members
- **Click to Whisper** — left-click any online member to start a whisper
- **Resizable Window** — drag the bottom-right grip; size persists across sessions
- **LDB Minimap Button** — quick access with guild stats in the tooltip
- **Dark Polished UI** — clean dark theme with gold accents matching the MM addon suite

## Configuration

### Alt Detection

Lua patterns checked case-insensitively against public and officer notes. One pattern per line.

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `^alt` | Notes starting with "ALT" (e.g. `ALT Ikoris - 340 ilvl`) |
| `^twink` | Notes starting with "TWINK" |
| `alt of` | Notes containing "alt of" |

### Item Level Extraction

Lua patterns with a `(%d+)` capture group to extract item level from notes. First match wins.

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `(%d+)%s*ilvl` | `230 ilvl` |
| `ilvl%s*(%d+)` | `ilvl 230` |
| `(%d+)%s*-%s*ilvl` | `251 - ilvl` |

### Role Detection (By Role grouping)

Role is detected from guild notes (public + officer) using keyword matching:

| Keyword | Role |
|---------|------|
| `tank` | Tank |
| `heal` (also `heals`, `healer`) | Healer |
| `dps` | DPS |
| `all` | Duplicated into Tank, Healer, and DPS |
| *(no match)* | Unknown |

Examples: `DPS - 251 - ilvl PVE` → DPS, `PVP - 1425 - HEALS` → Healer, `ALL` → all three groups.

### Other Settings

- **Raid Ready Level** — level threshold for the raid-ready counter
- **Default Group Mode** — which grouping to use when opening the window
- **Show/Hide Minimap Button**
